/**
 * Collatz Conjecture :
 * Pick any whole number. If it's even, divide it by 2. If it's odd, multiply
 * it by 3 and add 1. Then repeat with the answer as the input.
 * The Collatz conjecture states that every whole number integer, right the way
 * up to infinity, will eventually get you trapped in that 4-2-1 loop.

 * Learned about it here: https://www.reddit.com/comments/7n97dk//ds011mx/
